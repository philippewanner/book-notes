# Chapter 1 - Introduction

Fundamental principles characterizing best programming practices:
- Components should be as small as possible but not smaller.
- Code should be reused rather than copied.
- The dependencies between components should be kept to a minimum.
- Errors should be detected as soon as possible after they are made, ideally at compile time.

The language supports four kinds of types: 
- interfaces (including annotations),
- classes (including enums),
- arrays,
- primitives.

The first three are known as reference types. Class instances and arrays are objects; primitive value are not. A class's
members consist of its fields, methods, member classes, and member interfaces. A method signature consists of its name
and the types of its formal parameters; the signature does not include the method's return type.
