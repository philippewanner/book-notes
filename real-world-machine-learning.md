# 1. What is machine learning?

## 1.1 Understand how machines learn
- When we talk about human learning, we distinguish between memorization, and true intelligence.
- When children play in groups, they observe how others respond to their actions. Their future social behaviors are informed by this experience.
- They assess each new situation based on the features it has in common with past situations. Their learning is more than gathering knowledge. They're building what might be called *insight*.
- The ability to generalize, to apply knowledge gained through training to new unseen examples, is a key characteristic of both human and machine learning.
- What's the difference between AI and Machine Learning?
